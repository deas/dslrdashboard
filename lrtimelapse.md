# LRTimelapse help screen #

With the help of [LRTimelapse](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=1135649&c=ib&aff=255612&cl=220796) help screen in DslrDashboard you can monitor your time-lapse session
and eventually make some changes to camera exposure settings if needed.

By monitoring the histogram when shooting Sunsets/Sunrises and changing Exposure/ISO accordingly from time to time as it gets darker or brighter you will be able to capture time lapses with a huge dynamic range without the need to use HDR, bulp ramping or other complicated and inferior techniques. DSLR Dashboard helps you to make all those adjustments without touching the camera and lets you do all you need to via this one, streamlined screen.
You will then use the Software LRTimelapse to easily compensate for that adjustments by intelligently tweaking the Metadata of the images and using Lightroom or Adobe Camera RAW and LRTimelapse to render a smooth time lapse transition from day to night without any visible jumps.
Please find all information about LRTimelapse and the so called "Holy Grail Method" of time lapse shooting including video tutorials and a free test version on [LRTimelapse](http://lrtimelapse.com).
